<p>Adaptive images are the current hot topic in the Adaptive Design and Responsive Web Design conversations. Why? Because no one likes any of the solutions. New elements and attributes are being discussed as a solution for what is, for most of us, a big headache.
</p>
<p>
We have foreground and background images. We have large displays and small displays. We have regular resolution and high resolution displays. We have good bandwidth and low bandwidth connections.
</p>
<p>
Some choose to "waste bandwidth" (and memory) by sending high-resolution images to all devices. Others send regular resolution images to all devices which look less crisp on high resolution displays. What we really want to do is send the most appropriate size and resolution image based on the browser and device making the request.</p>
<p> We've solved adaptive images when it comes to background images. Media queries make it almost simple to send the right size and resolution images based on the device pixel ratio, viewport size and even the orientation of the screen. By using media queries with our background image styles, we can mark up our code to ensure that only the images we will be using are downloaded from the server. We can limit the downloads to the assets that are most appropriate, saving bandwidth, memory and http requests. Unfortunately, there has historically been no solution for foreground images. Until now.
</p>

<h2>Proposed solutions with new technology</h2>

<p>
With content images, it's a bit more difficult to have the browser download and display only the appropriate foreground image. Most believe that there is no mechanism for the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag to download the right size and resolution image. <a href="https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill">Polyfills</a> have been created. <a href="http://sencha.com/products.io">Services</a> have been formed.
</p>
<p>
The <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html-picture-element/#the-picture-element">&lt;picture&gt;</a></code> element, leveraging the semantics of the HTML5 <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> elements with its support of media queries to swap in different source file,s was proposed:</p>

<pre>&lt;<strong>picture</strong> alt="responsive image"&gt;
     &lt;source src=&quot;large.jpg&quot; media="(min-width:1600px), (min-resolution: 136dpi) and (min-width:800px)"&gt;
     &lt;source src=&quot;medium.jpg&quot; media="(min-width:800px), (min-resolution: 136dpi) and (min-width:400px)"&gt;
     &lt;source src=&quot;small.jpg&quot;&gt;
        &lt;!-- fallback --&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;small.jpg&quot; alt="responsive image"&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;</pre>

<p>Another method, using a <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/srcset/w3c-srcset/"><code> srcset</code> attribute</a> on the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element has also been proposed. The above would be written as:
</p>
<pre> &lt;img alt="responsive image"
           src="small.jpg"
           <strong>srcset</strong>="large.jpg 1600w, large.jpg 800w 1.95x, medium.jpg 800w, medium.jpg 400w 1.95x"&gt;</pre>

<h2>Possible Solutions with Existing Tech: SVG</h2>

<p>
What many people don't realize is we already have the technology to serve responsive images. We've had browser support for responsive images for a long, long time! SVG has supported media queries for a long time, and <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=svg">browsers have supported SVG</a> for ... well, not quite a long time, but still. Most browsers support media queries in  SVG (<a href="http://jeremie.patonnier.net/experiences/svg/media-queries/test.html">test your browser</a>). When it comes to browsers that need responsive images, the only browser in the mobile space that doesn't support SVG is  old versions of the Android browser. Android support for SVG began with Android 3.0.</p>
<p>We can leverage browser support for SVG and SVG support for both media queries and raster images to create responsive images, using media queries within SVG to serve up the right image. </p>
<p>When you mark up your HTML, you simply add a single call to an SVG file.</p>
<pre>&lt;img src=&quot;awesomefile.svg&quot; alt=&quot;responsive image&quot;&gt;</pre>
<p>Now isn't that code simple?</p>
<p>In our SVG file, using the <code>&lt;image&gt;</code> element, we include  all the images that we may need to serve, and include all the media queries.</p>
<p>Here is the code for one of the <a href="http://estelle.github.io/clowncar/local.svg">SVG files</a>: </p>
<pre>&lt;svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;329&quot;&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;The Clown Car Technique&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;defs&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;
    image {display: none;}
    #small {display: block}
     @media screen and (min-width: 401px) and (max-width: 700px) {
        #medium {display: block}
        #small {display: none}
    }
      @media screen and (min-width: 701px) and (max-width: 1000px) {
        #big {display: block}
        #small {display: none}
    }
     @media screen and (min-width: 1001px)  {
      #huge {display: block}
      #small {display: none;}
    }
    &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;/defs&gt;
  &lt;g&gt;
    &lt;image id=&quot;small&quot;  height=&quot;329&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; xlink:href=&quot;images/small.png&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;image id=&quot;medium&quot; height=&quot;329&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; xlink:href=&quot;images/medium.png&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;image id=&quot;big&quot;    height=&quot;329&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; xlink:href=&quot;images/big.png&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;image id=&quot;huge&quot;   height=&quot;329&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; xlink:href=&quot;images/huge.png&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/g&gt;
  &lt;/svg&gt;</pre>
<p>This file  works  in all browsers that support SVG if you  <a href="http://estelle.github.io/clowncar/local.svg">open the SVG above in your browser</a>. When this file is loaded, however, all 4 PNGs are retrieved from the server, making 4 additional  http requests, wasting bandwidth on files that will not be used, and wasting memory. </p>
<p>There is another drawback. If you include this image as you would a normal image:</p>
<pre>&lt;img src=&quot;awesomefile.svg&quot; alt=&quot;responsive image&quot;&gt;</pre>
<p>the SVG fails to load. While we previously saw that the browser can indeed render the SVG, if the SVG is included in our document via the &lt;img&gt; tag, the SVG fails to render. To prevent cross domain scripting attacks, the content security policies of most browsers do not allow SVG to import media or scripts. </p>
<p>We have two issues to solve. 1) Downloading all the different image file sizes doesn't solve our bandwidth issue, and 2 browsers not rendering the content of the SVG defeats the whole point. Let's start with the number of http requests:</p>
<p>We know from background image that it is indeed possible to get the browser to only download needed images. In CSS we can do this with background images. To prevent the SVG from downloading all the included images we can use the CSS background images instead of foreground image in our SVG file:</p>
<pre>
&lt;svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 300 329&quot; preserveAspectRatio=&quot;xMidYMid meet&quot;&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;Clown Car Technique&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;style&gt; 
  svg {
    background-size: 100% 100%;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
  } 
 @media screen and (max-width: 400px) {
  svg {background-image: url(images/small.png&quot;);}
 } 
 @media screen and (min-width: 401px) and (max-width: 700px) {
  svg {background-image: url(images/medium.png);}
 } 
 @media screen and (min-width: 701px) and (max-width: 1000px) {
  svg {background-image: url(images/big.png);}
 } 
 @media screen and (min-width: 1001px) {
  svg {background-image: url(images/huge.png);}
 }
 &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;</pre>
<p>If you're familiar with media queries and CSS, most of the above should make complete sense. The clown car technique uses the exact same @media queries as you would use elsewehere in your adaptive site. </p>
<p>However, there is structure to our SVG. Unlike the &lt;image&gt; version, we don't have any content in our SVG. To preserve the aspect ratioof our graphics and ensure that is scales uniformly, we include the viewbox  and preserveAspectRatio attributes.</p>
<p>The value of the viewBox attribute is a list of four space or comma separated numbers min-x, min-y, width and height. By defining the width and the height of our viewbox we define the aspect ratio of the image. The values we set for the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/SVG/Attribute/preserveAspectRatio">preserveAspectRatio</a> attribute ensures that the aspect ratio defined in viewbox is preserved.</p>
<p>When you<a href="http://estelle.github.io/clowncar/bgonly.svg"> open the SVG file with just the background images</a> defined, the raster image will take up the entire viewport, but when you include the SVG in a separate document, the aspect ratio is by default preserved. </p>
<p>This solves the http request issue. <a href="http://estelle.github.io/clowncar/bgonly.svg"> Open the SVG file with just the background images</a> and look at the resources tab in your developer tools and you'll see the SVG has only made 2 http requests rather than 5. If you are on a large monitor, the browser will have downloaded bgonly.svg (676 bytes) and huge.png.</p>
<p>Our first issue -- downloading all the different image file sizes, even those that aren't needed -- has been resolved.This background-image version only downloads the images required, thereby solving the multi-HTTP and waste of bandwidth concerns. However, it seems to trigger more content security issues than the previous SVG.</p>
<p>Open the <a href="http://estelle.github.io/clowncar/local.svg">first SVG file</a> or the <a href="http://estelle.github.io/clowncar/bgonly.svg">second SVG file</a> in your browser, then resize your browser window.</p>
<p> When you include the SVG in your HTML <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> with a flexible width, such as 70% of viewport, as you grow and shrink the container, the image responds to the changes. The &quot;width&quot;  media query in the SVG is based on the parent element in which the SVG is contained, not the viewport width. As the window grows and shrinks the image display by the SVG changes. In the first SVG file, the image size appears to stay the same -- because it is the same. In the SVG, all the &lt;image&gt; elements to have the same dimensions. In the second SVG file, the images are defined as being 100% of the height and width or the parent, which is this case is the veiwport. Its when we include the SVG in a flexible layout that the magic happens. You'll note that the first time you load the second one there may be flickers of white as the browser requests the next required PNG -- this is because unlike the first SVG file, it doesn't automatically download all the asset it doesn't need.</p>
<p> These foreground images work perfectly in Opera. In Chrome and Safari, I need to open the SVG file first, after which the HTML file containing the foreground SVG image works perfectly*. In Firefox, the SVG works. Firefox  supports SVG and supports SVG as background image, but blocks the importing of external raster images due to their content security policies.</p>
<p>The content security policy does make sense: you don't want a file to be pulling in untrustworthy content. SVG technology is supported. It is just being prevented from pulling in external raster images. Firefox prevents it altogether. Safari and Chrome work if the SVG is preloaded. I have sumbitted a <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=234082">Chrome bug report</a>  to get the ban on importing raster image in SVG lifted. For right now the simple line:</p>
<pre>&lt;img src=&quot;awesomefile.svg&quot; alt=&quot;responsive image&quot;&gt;
</pre>
<p>is blocked in some browsers, and therefore isn't the full solution. </p>
<p>Browsers  all support  SVG media queries. They all support SVG as foreground or content images. They all support SVG as background images. The support just isn't all the same because of browser security policies.</p>
<p>Without making changes to the browser security policy, &lt;img&gt; alone won't work. yet. We need to leverage the &lt;object&gt; tag.</p>
<h2>With &lt;object&gt; tag</h2>
<p>The <strong> &lt;object&gt;</strong> element allows an external resource to be treated as an image.&lt;object&gt; can take care of the browser security  drawbacks we see with &lt;img&gt; that disallows the importing of images or script into an &lt;img&gt; file. &lt;object&gt; allows both.</p>
<p>The code isn't that much more complex:</p>
<pre>&lt;object data=&quot;awesomefile.svg&quot; type="image/svg+xml"&gt;&lt;/object&gt;</pre>
<p>By default, the &lt;object&gt; will be as wide as the parent element. However, similar to images, you can declare a width and height with the width and height attributes or with the CSS width and height properties. Simply declare just one value to ensure that the SVG maintains it's original aspect ratio. Because of the viewbox and preserveAspectRatio declarations in our SVG file, the &lt;object&gt; will by default maintain the declared aspect ratio. You can overwrite this with HTML or CSS attributes.</p>
<p>Note that the matched media queries in the SVG file will reflect the parent of the &lt;object&gt; tag rather than the viewport.</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>&lt;object&gt; is supported in all browsers, even mobile browsers. But this technique only works if the browser supports SVG too. If you want, you can include the &lt;img&gt; tag nested in the &lt;object&gt; for browsers that don't support the data type. In this way you can also include an alt attribute.</p>
<p>&lt;object data=&quot;awesomefile.svg&quot; type="image/svg+xml"&gt;<br>
  &lt;img src=&quot;medium.png&quot; alt=&quot;responsive image&quot;&gt;<br>
  &lt;/object&gt;</p>
<p>Note: This method downloads both an SVG file and the image file that the SVG calls, creating two http requests instead of one. If you are concerned about this additional http requests, you can create a SVG data URI instead of calling in an external SVG file. </p>
<h2>Why Clown Car Technique</h2>
<p>Another asset of the &quot;Clown Car&quot; technique is that all the logic remains in the SVG file. Similar to how we separate content from presentation from behavior: this method enables us to also separate out images -- all the logic is in the SVG image instead of polluting our CSS or HTML.</p>
<p>With naming help from <a href="http://christopherschmitt.com/">Christopher Schmitt</a>, I called it the Clown Car technique since we are including many large images (clowns) into a tiny single SVG image file (car).</p>
<p>The main question is: should we attempt this with &lt;object&gt;, or should we get browser vendors to change their content security policy?</p>
